Last Updated: 3/13/2025 | 1855 hours on Thursday

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. By accessing or using the One Bot service (“Service”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.

1. Definitions
Service: The “One Bot” Discord bot, which provides auto-moderation, moderation tools, and other features as described herein.
User: Any individual or entity that accesses or uses the Service.
Account Data: Information, including your Discord User ID, that is collected and stored for the functioning of the Service.
Alpha Stage: The current developmental phase of the Service during which outages, errors, and performance issues may occur.
Strike: A formal notice issued to a user or server owner for violations of these Terms. Accumulation of strikes may result in blacklisting.
2. Eligibility
By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to enter into these Terms and that you are not barred from using the Service under any applicable law.

3. Description of the Service
One Bot is designed primarily to offer auto-moderation and moderation tools for Discord communities of any size. The Service is currently in the Alpha stage, and as such, may experience unanticipated outages or errors. Performance and availability of the Service are dependent on the developer’s resources and the willingness of community members and investors to support the bot.

4. Data Collection and Privacy
Data Collected: One Bot collects only Discord User IDs and stores them securely in a Mongoose database. These IDs are used for:
Supporting the functionality of the Service’s economy system.
Delivering user-specific notifications (e.g., updates, alerts).
Opt-Out: Users may opt out at any time. Opt-out instructions will be provided via the Service or upon request.
Data Sharing: One Bot does not share any collected personal information with third parties under any circumstances.
Data Security: We utilize Mongoose DB’s robust security features to protect all collected data.
5. User-Generated Content and Intellectual Property
Current Status: At present, the Service does not allow users to submit content through the bot. However, this may change in the future based on community demand.
Intellectual Property: Any future content submissions will be governed by additional guidelines, and users will retain ownership of their original content, subject to any rights granted to One Bot for display, distribution, or use in connection with the Service.
6. Acceptable Use and User Obligations
Proper Usage: Users must utilize the Service strictly in accordance with its intended functions and commands.
Prohibited Conduct: Misuse of the Service, including any actions that interfere with its proper operation, is strictly prohibited. Violations may be reported to Discord for further action.
Enforcement: Violations will result in the issuance of a “strike” to the offending user or server. Upon accumulation of three strikes, the offending user or the respective server owner—and potentially the server as a whole—may be blacklisted from using the Service.
7. Payment, Premium Features, and Donations
Current Service: One Bot is currently offered free of charge.
Future Services: In the future, premium or paid features may be introduced. Any such changes will be communicated in advance and will be subject to separate terms.
Donations: The continued operation and development of One Bot may depend on voluntary donations from the community. Donation practices will be handled in accordance with applicable law.
8. Service Availability and Disclaimers
Alpha Stage Disclaimer: One Bot is provided “as-is” and “as available” during its Alpha stage. Users acknowledge that there may be unexpected outages, errors, or interruptions in service.
No Warranty: Except as expressly provided herein, One Bot makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding the Service’s performance, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose.
Limitation of Liability: In no event shall One Bot or its developer be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Service.
9. Modification and Termination
Modification of Terms: One Bot reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Users will be notified of changes through a “hard” mass DM notification if their User ID is present in the database.
Termination: One Bot reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at its sole discretion, including but not limited to, violations of these Terms or other misconduct.
10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
Governing Law: These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States. The Service shall also comply with applicable laws of other jurisdictions and Discord’s Terms of Service.
Dispute Resolution: Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved in accordance with applicable law, and users agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the appropriate courts.
11. Miscellaneous
Third-Party Integrations: The Service may incorporate or interface with third-party services, including Discord. Use of the Service is additionally governed by the terms and policies of these third-party providers.
Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be severed, and the remainder of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect.
Entire Agreement: These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and One Bot regarding your use of the Service and supersede all prior understandings, agreements, or representations.
