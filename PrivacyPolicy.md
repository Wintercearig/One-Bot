# Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 3/13/2025 | 1855 hours on Thursday

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how One Bot ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects information obtained through the One Bot Discord service (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you ("User" or "you") agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Policy.

1. ## Information We Collect
1.1 User Identification and Economy Data
Discord User IDs: We collect your Discord User ID to facilitate the functionality of our Service.
Economy and Profile Data: In addition to your ID, we track various data points associated with our economy and personal profile features. This includes, but is not limited to:
Monetary balances (wallet and bank)
Blacklist status and strikes
Economy-related timestamps (e.g., lastDaily, lastWeekly, lastMonthly, lastYearly, lastTip)
Personal bot belongings, such as pets, leveling systems, and current level
AFK status, custom reminders, and notification preferences
Starboarded messages
Data is only stored for a particular user as long as they have corresponding features enabled or active. If a feature is unused or removed, related data will not persist in the user database.
1.2 Purpose of Data Collection
The primary purposes for collecting the aforementioned information are to:

Manage and operate the Service's economy and profile systems.
Deliver notifications, reminders, and updates (including Terms of Service and Privacy Policy changes) via direct messages.
Ensure that the Service functions according to user preferences and settings.
No data is collected or used for any malicious purposes.

2. ## Data Usage and Retention
2.1 Use of Collected Data
Functionality and Service Improvement: Data is used to personalize your experience, manage the Service’s economy, and enable features such as reminders and notifications.
Communication: We use your data to notify you of important updates, including changes to this Policy or the Terms of Service.
Moderation: Data may also be used to administer disciplinary actions (e.g., issuing strikes or blacklisting) if you misuse the Service.
2.2 Data Retention
Retention Period: Data is retained for as long as you choose to use the Service. In the future, you may have the ability to manage your data—such as deleting your per-server or global profile—which would remove all associated personal data, except for any information necessary to enforce ongoing moderation actions (e.g., current punishments).
Opt-Out and Deletion: You may opt out of receiving notifications or other features at any time. Upon opting out, your data related to such features will be removed immediately, except where retention is required for moderation or legal purposes (e.g., in cases of blacklisting).

3. ## Data Security
3.1 Security Measures
Platform Security: Our Service operates through Discord and uses Mongoose DB to store user data. We rely on the robust security measures provided by these platforms to protect your information.
"As-Is" Service: The bot is provided "as-is" without any additional public interfaces beyond its intended commands. Administrative commands (e.g., for refreshing commands or blacklisting) are restricted to bot owners.

4. ## Third-Party Services
Mongoose DB: The only third-party service that processes and stores your data is Mongoose DB. No other external parties have access to your personal information unless required by law.

5. ## User Rights and Choices
5.1 Opting Out
Notifications and Data Collection: You may opt out of receiving notifications, reminders, or even the collection of your Discord User ID. Note that this opt-out does not apply if you are subject to moderation actions (e.g., blacklisting).
5.2 Data Management
Future Data Management Tools: As the Service evolves, we plan to introduce features allowing you to manage your data, including deletion of your per-server profile or global profile. These tools will enable you to remove your personal data from our database, except for information required to enforce moderation decisions.

6. ## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If any material changes are made, we will notify you via a "hard" mass DM to all users whose data is stored in our database. Continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.

7. ## Governing Law
This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, and it is designed to comply with the laws of other applicable jurisdictions, including Discord’s own terms and policies.

8. ## Contact Information
If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us through our official Discord support server: https://discord.gg/2NrH7q9HVC.

By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
